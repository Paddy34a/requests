            <li>Enter a URL of choice, that you want to send a request to</li>
            <li>Choose an HTTP request method</li>
            <li>Choose the amount of requests you want to send. Note that changing the amount of requests to anything more than a single request will cause you to no longer get a response window afterwards.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Add request headers</li>
            <li>Add request content</li>
            <p>Both adding headers or content to the body of the request is optional, however you may wish or even need to do so to send a request to certain URLs</p>
            <p>Content added to the request body should be in a JSON-Syntax, allowing for easier passing into the request. Headers should follow a JSON-Like-Syntax, of which an example can be found by clicking the button down below.</p>
            <li>If all inputs were filled in correctly, a new window will pop up and display the request results, given that only a singular request was selected</li>
            <br>
            <strong>Note that if anything goes wrong with the request, whether it be falsely filled out inputs, parsing issues or a rejected request, you will in most if not all cases be able to gather more detailed information on what exactly went wrong.</strong>
